Historian Hysteria
Difficulty: 1/10
- First I layed out a plan for how I'd solve the problem
- Scan the file, create two lists, split the lines, add left numbers to left list, add right numbers to right list
- Create helper method to bubble sort each list
- Find the sum of the differences
- Return sum

Issues: I had small errors- I initially got the answer wrong because I messed up one of my for loops
(i>list.size() instead of i<list.size())

Part 2: Difficulty - 1/10 (Small Error: Got the wrong index- used i instead of j)

Red Nosed Reports- Completed December 20, 2024
Difficulty: 1/10
-Slightly more challenging to think through, but thought of method with little time
-Easier to debug than last one
Issues: Forgot to save changes in txt file (very puzzling) ALSO struggled for a moment with looping through strings

MullItOver
Difficulty: 7/10
I wasn't able to complete this one. While I knew how to detect whether or not a mul() was coming up in the text file,
I did not know how to determine when to stop trying to detect an integer/how I will determine when one integer ends and another begins.
In hind sight, I feel like I could have did a while loop and looped until the character at index i was not an integer or was a comma and then
use another while loop to determine if i was not an integer or ")".
