Day 1: Historian Hysteria - Completed December 20, 2024  
Difficulty: 1/10
- First I layed out a plan for how I'd solve the problem
- Scan the file, create two lists, split the lines, add left numbers to left list, add right numbers to right list
- Create helper method to bubble sort each list
- Find the sum of the differences
- Return sum

Issues: I had small errors- I initially got the answer wrong because I messed up one of my for loops
(i>list.size() instead of i<list.size())

Day 2: Red Nosed Reports- Completed December 20, 2024
Difficulty: 1/10
-Slightly more challenging to think through, but thought of method with little time
-Easier to debug than last one
Issues: Forgot to save changes in txt file (very puzzling) ALSO struggled for a moment with looping through strings
